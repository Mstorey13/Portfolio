            very glad I can say I live in a state that has In n Out. They have some of the best burgers, in my opinion.
            I am also a huge sushi fan. I really enjoy going to all you can eat sushi with my friends. You really can never 
            go wrong with tacos, there are so many options and toppings. I really enjoy eating at Tacos el Gordo in Las Vegas.

        <div class="bg-light text-dark border-light">Travelling is one of my favorite things to do! I really enjoy
            Northern California and Lake Tahoe. The first image is a photo I took at the beach in Santa Cruz. I love the 
            weather and boardwalk. The Second image is of San Francisco. I had found a hiking trail that got a great view 
            of the city. The view is a lot cooler in person compared to my phone. The final image is of Lake Tahoe. When
            living in Reno, I had went to Tahoe very often. The lake is stunning and there are many cool hiking trails.
